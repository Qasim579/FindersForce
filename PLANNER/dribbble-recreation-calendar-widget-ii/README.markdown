# Dribbble Recreation: Calendar Widget II

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/internette/pen/YqJEjY](https://codepen.io/internette/pen/YqJEjY).

Based off of https://dribbble.com/shots/2209385-Calendar-Widget-ll-Freebie by Hanna Jung. Only dependency is GSAP because hand coding that exponential curve was starting to turn into a nightmare :(. The next step would be to push all the calendar dates & months into an array of objects on load, then push each new event to said date. Then, potentially leverage local storage. Eventually, add a name slot (for your name) and a location slot for your address. Finally, include a weather API to depict that actual weather, if that data is available (since most weather forecasts only go up to 16 days).
